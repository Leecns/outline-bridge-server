# Outline Bridge Server

This repository contains Docker Compose files to run the V2Ray proxy as a bridge server for the Outline shadowsocks proxy.
It helps the Outline proxy to work in highly restricted networks without direct/safe/stable access to Outline servers.

## Documentation

### Outline

[Outline](https://getoutline.org) is a Shadowsocks-based proxy created by Google.
It lets you create and manage Shadowsocks servers easily.
Outline clients are also well-designed applications available for all platforms.

It usually works as below.

```
[Outline client] <-> [Outline server] <-> (Internet)
```

Read the [Outline official documentation](https://getoutline.org/get-started) to set up an Outline server.

### V2Ray as Bridge Server

The bridge server will be inserted between clients and a server to connect the clients to the server
in networks where this direct connection is not possible/safe/stable.
It runs a V2Ray proxy to pass the incoming Shadowsocks traffic (TCP and UDP) from clients to the Outline server.

The bridge server changes the flow as below.

```
[Outline client] <-> [V2Ray server] <-> [Outline server] <-> (Internet)
```

### Setup

Follow these steps to set up the V2Ray and Outline:

1. Install Docker and Docker-compose on the bridge server.
1. Clone this repository into the bridge server.
1. Run `./setup.py` script. It gets the following inputs:
    1. `Outline Server Hostname`: Find it in Outline Manager > {Server} > Settings > Hostname
    1. `Outline Server Port`: Find it in Outline Manager > {Server} > Settings > Port
    1. Allow the port for incoming/outcoming traffic if you have a firewall.
1. Run `docker-compose up -d`.
1. Change Outline Manager > {Server} > Settings > Hostname field to the bridge server IP address.
1. Delete old access keys in the Outline Manager and generate new ones.
1. Download [Outline client applications](https://getoutline.org/get-started/#step-3) and add the new access keys there.
1. Enjoy the freedom!

### Docker Images

By default, this repository uses the GitHub registry.
You can modify the Docker-compose file to use Docker Hub.
